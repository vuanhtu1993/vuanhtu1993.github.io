## Artifact Review

When starting a new Agent conversation, you can choose between two primary execution modes that determine how changes are proposed and reviewed:

-   **Planning Mode**: The agent plans thoroughly before executing tasks. In this mode, the agent organizes its work in [task groups](https://antigravity.google/docs/task-groups), produces structured implementation plans called [Artifacts](https://antigravity.google/docs/artifacts), and thoroughly researches the codebase for optimal quality.
-   **Fast Mode**: The agent executes tasks directly without a dedicated planning phase. Use this for simple, highly localized tasks that can be completed quickly, such as variable renaming, running a specific bash command, or small refactors.

When working in **Planning Mode**, the Artifact Review Policy controls how you interact with and approve these plans before changes are made to your codebase.

## Artifact Review Policy

You can customize the review workflow in the **Agent** tab of the Settings pane. Choose between two policies:

### 1\. Request Review (Recommended)

The agent always halts and requests your explicit approval before proceeding with proposed changes.

-   When the agent generates an implementation plan or code diff, it will pause execution and notify you.
-   This allows you to thoroughly review the proposed changes, add inline comments, and verify the plan in your workspace.
-   Once you are satisfied, you can approve the plan to let the agent proceed.

### 2\. Always Proceed

The agent never halts for manual review and immediately proceeds with executing its plans.

-   When the agent decides to request a review, it will immediately bypass the pause and continue with the implementation.
-   Use this if you want a fully autonomous workflow and do not need to manually verify plans before code is modified.

## Plugins & skills

Extend agent capabilities, install third-party extension bundles, package custom workflow skills, and interface with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## The extensibility model

Antigravity CLI is designed for limitless customization. You can augment the shared agent harness by installing structured package modules called **Plugins** or creating localized markdown blueprints called **Skills**.

These customizations allow agents to access specialized proprietary commands, invoke domain-specific subagents, and consult customized style constraints.

## Antigravity plugins

Plugins are namespaced bundles that package custom skills, background subagents, linting rules, Model Context Protocol definitions, and event hooks into a single deployable asset.

### Plugin filesystem structure

When you install or import a plugin, the CLI stages the bundle files within your global configuration path:

            `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/plugins/<plugin_name>/`
        

A compliant plugin contains the following layout:

            `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/plugins/<plugin_name>/ ├── plugin.json                 # Required package marker file ├── mcp_config.json             # Optional Model Context Protocol servers ├── hooks.json                  # Optional pre/post tool event hooks ├── skills/                     # Optional specialized skills directory ├── agents/                     # Optional subagent definition templates └── rules/                      # Optional custom codebase rules files`
        

### Managing plugins via CLI subcommands

The CLI exposes a `plugin` (or plural `plugins`) subcommand pipeline to manage your extensions:

-   **List installed plugins**: Show active packages and their loaded components.

              `  agy plugin list`
        

-   **Install a local or remote plugin**: Stage a package directory into your local profile.

              `  agy plugin install /path/to/local/plugin`
        

-   **Disable/Enable a plugin**: Suspend a plugin's tools without deleting its assets.

              `  agy plugin disable <plugin_name>   agy plugin enable <plugin_name>`
        

-   **Uninstall a plugin**: Purge the package directory and clean up registries.

              `  agy plugin uninstall <plugin_name>`
        

## Agent skills

Skills are declarative, human-readable markdown files that outline explicit instruction protocols, scripts, and target resources for specialized engineering tasks.

Once registered, **Skills convert automatically into slash commands** inside the TUI, allowing you to invoke them manually (e.g., typing `/refactor-ui`).

### Creating local workspace skills

To deploy workspace-specific skills that stay with your git repository:

1.  Create a directory named `.agents/skills/` at your project root.
2.  Inside, draft a markdown file with a `.md` extension (such as `format-tests.md`).
3.  Define the skill's Frontmatter metadata:

               `   ---    name: format-tests    description: Standardize and re-format Python unittest assertions    ---`
        

1.  Below the metadata, write explicit instructions for the agent. When you run `agy` in this directory, the skill is compiled, and `/format-tests` becomes available in the prompt box.

### Sharing global skills

To share skills across all workspaces on your workstation, place the target markdown files inside your global configuration path:

            `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`
        

Any markdown skill in this directory is automatically imported as a global slash command whenever you launch `agy` in any directory.

## Managing hooks

Hooks intercept agent actions right before or immediately after execution. They are useful for running automated pre-flight checks or post-generation formats (such as running `prettier` after writing files).

Hooks are defined inside a plugin's `hooks.json` or configured inside your primary `settings.json` file. You can inspect all loaded and active hooks inside the TUI by typing:

            `/hooks`
        

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol is an open standard enabling foundation models to interface securely with local APIs, file parsers, and custom developer tools.

Antigravity CLI supports both local processes and remote host MCP server configurations.

### Accessing the MCP manager

Type `/mcp` inside the prompt panel and press `Enter` to open the interactive **MCP Manager Overlay**. This panel allows you to:

-   View live status rings for active, disconnected, or loading servers.
-   Manually reload server configurations or check connection logs.

### Global and workspace server configs

Unlike legacy setups, Antigravity separates MCP definitions into dedicated, sparse configurations:

-   **Global server setups**: Configured in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/mcp_config.json`.
-   **Workspace local setups**: Configured in your active project under `.agents/mcp_config.json`.

            `{   "mcpServers": {     "sqlite-explorer": {       "command": "node",       "args": [         "/usr/local/bin/sqlite-mcp-server.js"       ],       "env": {         "SQLITE_DB_PATH": "/var/data/app.db"       }     }   } }`
        

warning

**Remote Connection Schema**: When declaring remote SSE or websocket-based MCP connections, you must define the `serverUrl` field. Legacy fields like `url` or `httpUrl` are not supported.

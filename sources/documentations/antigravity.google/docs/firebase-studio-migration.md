## Firebase Studio Migration

Antigravity is Google's next-generation, agent-first platform. It’s designed to be the primary home for high-velocity, autonomous development workflows. Instead of relying on just a cloud-based web editor, Antigravity brings the power of AI right into your local development environment.

Antigravity offers significant enhancements over the web-based Code view in Firebase Studio:

-   **Local environment control**: Antigravity runs locally on your machine, which means you have full control over your filesystem, versions, and terminal.
-   **True agentic development**: Move beyond basic code completion. Antigravity provides agentic development workflows that can autonomously format, test, and implement entire tasks across your codebase.
-   **Seamless Firebase support**: You can still easily deploy your projects to Firebase, communicate with Firebase services via the Firebase CLI, and test your functions locally as you always have.

## Learn how to navigate Antigravity

To help you settle in, here is where you can find your favorite Firebase Studio features in Antigravity:

## Migrate your Firebase Studio project to Antigravity

Antigravity is a local, agent-first IDE that brings the power of AI into your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed locally and fully up-to-date:

-   [Google Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.google/download)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 20 or higher)
-   [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (version 15.10.0 or higher)

### Step 1: Export and initialize your app

**Option 1: Automated migration**

This workflow uses the Antigravity agent to autonomously handle project transformation.

1.  In Firebase Studio, click the **Move now** button at the top of your workspace.
2.  Follow the export method based on the window that appears:

-   If you see a **Zip and Download** button, click it.
-   Otherwise, open the command palette (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Mac or `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on ChromeOS, Windows, or Linux) and run the **Firebase Studio: Zip & Download** command.

1.  Extract the folder locally and open it in Antigravity.
2.  In the Agent pane within Antigravity, enter the following prompt. To optimize your workflow and conserve tokens, we recommend selecting the **Gemini Flash** model. It’s designed for speed and efficiency in high-volume transformation tasks like file conversion.

            `@fbs-to-agy-export`
        

The Antigravity agent will then begin project migration, requesting your assistance along the way. Follow the agent’s guidance to complete the migration process. If you encounter any errors, prompt the agent to try again.

If the download window doesn’t appear, check your browser’s address bar for a pop-up blocker icon and ensure pop-ups are allowed.

**Option 2: Manual export**

If you prefer to manage the migration yourself without using AI tokens, you can use the Firebase CLI to manually export your project. This method is direct and does not require agent interaction.

Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `<path>` with the file path to your extracted project folder or the original `.zip` file:

            `npx firebase-tools@latest studio:export <path>`
        

warning

The `studio:export` command is currently optimized for Next.js, Flutter, and Angular workspaces. While you can use this command for other workspace types, the migration may not be fully successful. We’re actively working to improve the migration flow.

### Step 2: Preview your app

Once you have extracted your project and opened it within Antigravity, you can view your application locally:

1.  In Antigravity, navigate to the **Run and Debug** menu located in the left sidebar.
2.  Click the play button to start your local development server.
3.  Follow the instructions in the terminal to preview your app.

To refine your app or troubleshoot issues, simply chat with the agent using natural language. If the agent pane is hidden, click the Toggle Agent icon at the top of the window to reopen it.

### Step 3: Publish your app

Antigravity uses agent skills to publish your app using Firebase best practices.

1.  In the chat panel, enter the following prompt: simply instruct the agent:

            `Publish my app`
        

1.  When prompted to run `firebase deploy`, choose **Yes**. The agent will publish to your existing URL if you’ve previously published to App Hosting. If this is your first time publishing to App Hosting, the agent will walk you through the process.
2.  For future updates, simply instruct the agent to `publish my app` in the Antigravity chat panel.

## Continue your work

There are several ways you can continue your development in Antigravity.

-   **Running workflows:** In Antigravity, you can seamlessly execute workflows and continue your work with the model by typing `@workflows <workflow_name>` into the agentic chat panel.
-   **App Hosting deployments:** You can seamlessly deploy your apps directly through the agent using agent skills, or by using the platform-agnostic Firebase CLI and GitHub.
-   **Troubleshooting:** If you experience deployment issues, try re-authenticating with the Firebase CLI or verifying your project secrets.

Thank you for being part of the Firebase Studio journey. Your prototypes and feedback have directly shaped Google's AI tools, and we can’t wait to see what you build next in Antigravity!

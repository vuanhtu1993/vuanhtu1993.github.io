As you try to understand the Node.js event loop, one important part of it is `process.nextTick()`. Every time the runtime calls back into JavaScript for an event, we call it a tick.

When we pass a function to `process.nextTick()`, we schedule it to run immediately after the current call stack completes, before the event loop continues and before any other queued tasks or phases are processed:

```
process.nextTick(() => {
  // do something
});
```

The event loop is busy processing the current function code. When this operation ends, the JS engine runs all the functions passed to `nextTick` calls during that operation.

It's the way we can tell the JS engine to process a function asynchronously (after the current function), but as soon as possible, not queue it.

Calling `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)` schedules the callback for a future event loop iteration, much later than when using `process.nextTick()`, which executes before the event loop continues.

Use `nextTick()` when you want to make sure that in the next event loop iteration that code is already executed.

## Overview

Memory is a system that remembers information about previous interactions. For AI agents, memory is crucial because it lets them remember previous interactions, learn from feedback, and adapt to user preferences. As agents tackle more complex tasks with numerous user interactions, this capability becomes essential for both efficiency and user satisfaction. Short term memory lets your application remember previous interactions within a single thread or conversation.

Conversation history is the most common form of short-term memory. Long conversations pose a challenge to today’s LLMs; a full history may not fit inside an LLM’s context window, resulting in an context loss or errors. Even if your model supports the full context length, most LLMs still perform poorly over long contexts. They get “distracted” by stale or off-topic content, all while suffering from slower response times and higher costs. Chat models accept context using [messages](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/messages), which include instructions (a system message) and inputs (human messages). In chat applications, messages alternate between human inputs and model responses, resulting in a list of messages that grows longer over time. Because context windows are limited, many applications can benefit from using techniques to remove or “forget” stale information.

## Usage

To add short-term memory (thread-level persistence) to an agent, you need to specify a `checkpointer` when creating an agent.

### In production

In production, use a checkpointer backed by a database:

```
import { PostgresSaver } from "@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres";

const DB_URI = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable";
const checkpointer = PostgresSaver.fromConnString(DB_URI);
```

## Customizing agent memory

You can extend the agent state by creating custom middleware with a state schema. Custom state schemas can be passed using the `stateSchema` parameter in middleware. Use the `StateSchema` class for state definitions preferably (plain Zod objects are also supported).

```
import { createAgent, createMiddleware } from "langchain";
import { StateSchema, MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import * as z from "zod";

const CustomState = new StateSchema({
    userId: z.string(),
    preferences: z.record(z.string(), z.any()),
});

const stateExtensionMiddleware = createMiddleware({
    name: "StateExtension",
    stateSchema: CustomState,
});

const checkpointer = new MemorySaver();
const agent = createAgent({
    model: "gpt-5.5",
    tools: [],
    middleware: [stateExtensionMiddleware],
    checkpointer,
});

// Custom state can be passed in invoke
const result = await agent.invoke({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
    userId: "user_123",
    preferences: { theme: "dark" },
});
```

## Common patterns

With [short-term memory](#usage) enabled, long conversations can exceed the LLM’s context window. Common solutions are:

This allows the agent to keep track of the conversation without exceeding the LLM’s context window.

### Trim messages

Most LLMs have a maximum supported context window (denominated in tokens). One way to decide when to truncate messages is to count the tokens in the message history and truncate whenever it approaches that limit. If you’re using LangChain, you can use the trim messages utility and specify the number of tokens to keep from the list, as well as the `strategy` (e.g., keep the last `maxTokens`) to use for handling the boundary. To trim message history in an agent, use [`createMiddleware`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/langchain/index/createMiddleware) with a `beforeModel` hook:

```
import { RemoveMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { createAgent, createMiddleware } from "langchain";
import { MemorySaver, REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const trimMessages = createMiddleware({
  name: "TrimMessages",
  beforeModel: (state) => {
    const messages = state.messages;

    if (messages.length <= 3) {
      return; // No changes needed
    }

    const firstMsg = messages[0];
    const recentMessages =
      messages.length % 2 === 0 ? messages.slice(-3) : messages.slice(-4);
    const newMessages = [firstMsg, ...recentMessages];

    return {
      messages: [
        new RemoveMessage({ id: REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES }),
        ...newMessages,
      ],
    };
  },
});

const checkpointer = new MemorySaver();
const agent = createAgent({
  model: "gpt-5.5",
  tools: [...],
  middleware: [trimMessages],
  checkpointer,
});
```

### Delete messages

You can delete messages from the graph state to manage the message history. This is useful when you want to remove specific messages or clear the entire message history. To delete messages from the graph state, you can use the `RemoveMessage`. For `RemoveMessage` to work, you need to use a state key with [`messagesStateReducer`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/langchain-langgraph/index/messagesStateReducer) [reducer](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/graph-api#reducers), like `MessagesValue`. To remove specific messages:

```
import { RemoveMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const deleteMessages = (state) => {
    const messages = state.messages;
    if (messages.length > 2) {
        // remove the earliest two messages
        return {
        messages: messages
            .slice(0, 2)
            .map((m) => new RemoveMessage({ id: m.id })),
        };
    }
};
```

```
import { RemoveMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { createAgent, createMiddleware } from "langchain";
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const deleteOldMessages = createMiddleware({
  name: "DeleteOldMessages",
  afterModel: (state) => {
    const messages = state.messages;
    if (messages.length > 2) {
      // remove the earliest two messages
      return {
        messages: messages
          .slice(0, 2)
          .map((m) => new RemoveMessage({ id: m.id! })),
      };
    }
    return;
  },
});

const agent = createAgent({
  model: "gpt-5.5",
  tools: [],
  systemPrompt: "Please be concise and to the point.",
  middleware: [deleteOldMessages],
  checkpointer: new MemorySaver(),
});

const config = { configurable: { thread_id: "1" } };

const streamA = await agent.stream(
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "hi! I'm bob" }] },
  { ...config, streamMode: "values" }
);
for await (const event of streamA) {
  const messageDetails = event.messages.map((message) => [
    message.getType(),
    message.content,
  ]);
  console.log(messageDetails);
}

const streamB = await agent.stream(
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "write a short poem about cats" }] },
  { ...config, streamMode: "values" }
);
for await (const event of streamB) {
  const messageDetails = event.messages.map((message) => [
    message.getType(),
    message.content,
  ]);
  console.log(messageDetails);
}

const streamC = await agent.stream(
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "what's my name?" }] },
  { ...config, streamMode: "values" }
);
for await (const event of streamC) {
  const messageDetails = event.messages.map((message) => [
    message.getType(),
    message.content,
  ]);
  console.log(messageDetails);
}
```

```
[["human", "hi! I'm bob"]]
[["human", "hi! I'm bob"], ["ai", "Hi Bob! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today? I can answer questions, brainstorm ideas, draft text, explain things, or help with code."]]
[["human", "hi! I'm bob"], ["ai", "Hi Bob! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today? I can answer questions, brainstorm ideas, draft text, explain things, or help with code."], ["human", "write a short poem about cats"]]
[["human", "hi! I'm bob"], ["ai", "Hi Bob! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today? I can answer questions, brainstorm ideas, draft text, explain things, or help with code."], ["human", "write a short poem about cats"], ["ai", "There once was a cat on a wall, Who barely moved at all..."]]
[["human", "write a short poem about cats"], ["ai", "There once was a cat on a wall, Who barely moved at all..."]]
[["human", "write a short poem about cats"], ["ai", "There once was a cat on a wall, Who barely moved at all..."], ["human", "what's my name?"]]
[["human", "write a short poem about cats"], ["ai", "There once was a cat on a wall, Who barely moved at all..."], ["human", "what's my name?"], ["ai", "I don't know your name - you haven't told me!"]]
[["human", "what's my name?"], ["ai", "I don't know your name - you haven't told me!"]]
```

### Summarize messages

The problem with trimming or removing messages, as shown above, is that you may lose information from culling of the message queue. Because of this, some applications benefit from a more sophisticated approach of summarizing the message history using a chat model. ![Summary](https://res.cloudinary.com/dv3vzmogk/image/upload/v1781707650/aha-mind/docs-crawler/docs.langchain.com/summary_dy8yvq.png) To summarize message history in an agent, use the built-in [`summarizationMiddleware`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/middleware#summarization):

```
import { createAgent, summarizationMiddleware } from "langchain";
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const checkpointer = new MemorySaver();

const agent = createAgent({
  model: "gpt-5.5",
  tools: [],
  middleware: [
    summarizationMiddleware({
      model: "gpt-5.4-mini",
      trigger: { tokens: 4000 },
      keep: { messages: 20 },
    }),
  ],
  checkpointer,
});

const config = { configurable: { thread_id: "1" } };
await agent.invoke({ messages: "hi, my name is bob" }, config);
await agent.invoke({ messages: "write a short poem about cats" }, config);
await agent.invoke({ messages: "now do the same but for dogs" }, config);
const finalResponse = await agent.invoke({ messages: "what's my name?" }, config);

console.log(finalResponse.messages.at(-1)?.content);
// Your name is Bob!
```

See [`summarizationMiddleware`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/middleware#summarization) for more configuration options.

## Access memory

You can access and modify the short-term memory (state) of an agent in several ways:

### Tools

#### Read short-term memory in a tool

Access short term memory (state) in a tool using the `runtime` parameter (typed as `ToolRuntime`). The `runtime` parameter is hidden from the tool signature (so the model doesn’t see it), but the tool can access the state through it.

```
import { createAgent, tool, type ToolRuntime } from "langchain";
import { StateSchema } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import * as z from "zod";

const CustomState = new StateSchema({
  userId: z.string(),
});

const getUserInfo = tool(
  async (_, config: ToolRuntime<typeof CustomState.State>) => {
    const userId = config.state.userId;
    return userId === "user_123" ? "John Doe" : "Unknown User";
  },
  {
    name: "get_user_info",
    description: "Get user info",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }
);

const agent = createAgent({
  model: "gpt-5-nano",
  tools: [getUserInfo],
  stateSchema: CustomState,
});

const result = await agent.invoke(
  {
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "what's my name?" }],
    userId: "user_123",
  },
  {
    context: {},
  }
);

console.log(result.messages.at(-1)?.content);
// Outputs: "Your name is John Doe."
```

#### Write short-term memory from tools

To modify the agent’s short-term memory (state) during execution, you can return state updates directly from the tools. This is useful for persisting intermediate results or making information accessible to subsequent tools or prompts.

```
import { tool, createAgent, ToolMessage, type ToolRuntime } from "langchain";
import { Command, StateSchema } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import * as z from "zod";

const CustomState = new StateSchema({
  userId: z.string().optional(),
});

const updateUserInfo = tool(
  async (_, config: ToolRuntime<typeof CustomState.State>) => {
    const userId = config.state.userId;
    const name = userId === "user_123" ? "John Smith" : "Unknown user";
    return new Command({
      update: {
        userName: name,
        // update the message history
        messages: [
          new ToolMessage({
            content: "Successfully looked up user information",
            tool_call_id: config.toolCall?.id ?? "",
          }),
        ],
      },
    });
  },
  {
    name: "update_user_info",
    description: "Look up and update user info.",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }
);

const greet = tool(
  async (_, config) => {
    const userName = config.context?.userName;
    return `Hello ${userName}!`;
  },
  {
    name: "greet",
    description: "Use this to greet the user once you found their info.",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }
);

const agent = createAgent({
  model: "openai:gpt-5-mini",
  tools: [updateUserInfo, greet],
  stateSchema: CustomState,
});

const result = await agent.invoke({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "greet the user" }],
  userId: "user_123",
});

console.log(result.messages.at(-1)?.content);
// Output: "Hello! I’m here to help — what would you like to do today?"
```

### Prompt

Access short term memory (state) in middleware to create dynamic prompts based on conversation history or custom state fields.

```
import * as z from "zod";
import { createAgent, tool, dynamicSystemPromptMiddleware } from "langchain";

const contextSchema = z.object({
  userName: z.string(),
});
type ContextSchema = z.infer<typeof contextSchema>;

const getWeather = tool(
  async ({ city }) => {
    return `The weather in ${city} is always sunny!`;
  },
  {
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get user info",
    schema: z.object({
      city: z.string(),
    }),
  }
);

const agent = createAgent({
  model: "gpt-5-nano",
  tools: [getWeather],
  contextSchema,
  middleware: [
    dynamicSystemPromptMiddleware<ContextSchema>((_, config) => {
      return `You are a helpful assistant. Address the user as ${config.context?.userName}.`;
    }),
  ],
});

const result = await agent.invoke(
  {
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF?" }],
  },
  {
    context: {
      userName: "John Smith",
    },
  }
);

for (const message of result.messages) {
  console.log(message);
}
/**
 * HumanMessage {
 *   "content": "What is the weather in SF?",
 *   // ...
 * }
 * AIMessage {
 *   // ...
 *   "tool_calls": [
 *     {
 *       "name": "get_weather",
 *       "args": {
 *         "city": "San Francisco"
 *       },
 *       "type": "tool_call",
 *       "id": "call_tCidbv0apTpQpEWb3O2zQ4Yx"
 *     }
 *   ],
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ToolMessage {
 *   "content": "The weather in San Francisco is always sunny!",
 *   "tool_call_id": "call_tCidbv0apTpQpEWb3O2zQ4Yx"
 *   // ...
 * }
 * AIMessage {
 *   "content": "John Smith, here's the latest: The weather in San Francisco is always sunny!\n\nIf you'd like more details (temperature, wind, humidity) or a forecast for the next few days, I can pull that up. What would you like?",
 *   // ...
 * }
 */
```

### Before model

```
import { RemoveMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { createAgent, createMiddleware, trimMessages } from "langchain";
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const trimMessageHistory = createMiddleware({
  name: "TrimMessages",
  beforeModel: async (state) => {
    const trimmed = await trimMessages(state.messages, {
      maxTokens: 384,
      strategy: "last",
      startOn: "human",
      endOn: ["human", "tool"],
      tokenCounter: (msgs) => msgs.length,
    });
    return {
      messages: [new RemoveMessage({ id: REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES }), ...trimmed],
    };
  },
});

const checkpointer = new MemorySaver();
const agent = createAgent({
  model: "gpt-5-nano",
  tools: [],
  middleware: [trimMessageHistory],
  checkpointer,
});
```

### After model

```
import { RemoveMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { createAgent, createMiddleware } from "langchain";
import { REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const validateResponse = createMiddleware({
  name: "ValidateResponse",
  afterModel: (state) => {
    const lastMessage = state.messages.at(-1)?.content;
    if (
      typeof lastMessage === "string" &&
      lastMessage.toLowerCase().includes("confidential")
    ) {
      return {
        messages: [
          new RemoveMessage({ id: REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES }),
        ],
      };
    }
    return;
  },
});

const agent = createAgent({
  model: "gpt-5-nano",
  tools: [],
  middleware: [validateResponse],
});
```

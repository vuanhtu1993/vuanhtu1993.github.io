Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents— including Klarna, Uber, J.P. Morgan, and more— LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents. LangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent **orchestration**. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with [models](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/models) and [tools](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/tools). We will commonly use [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/overview) components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don’t need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain’s [agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/agents) that provide prebuilt architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops. LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.

-   [Deep Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/deepagents/overview) is an [agent harness](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/concepts/products#agent-harnesses-like-the-deep-agents-sdk): planning, subagents, filesystem tools, and context management on top of LangGraph.
-   [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/overview) is the agent framework: abstractions and integrations for models, tools, and agent loops.
-   [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview) is the orchestration runtime: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and persistence.
-   [LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/observability) is the platform for tracing, evaluation, prompts, and deployment across frameworks.
-   [LangSmith Engine](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/engine) detects issues in your LangGraph agent traces and proposes fixes. You can open a pull request with the proposed fix directly from the Engine tab.
-   [LangSmith Fleet](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/fleet/index) is the no-code agent builder for templates, integrations, and routine automation.

## Install

Then, create a simple hello world example:

```
import { StateSchema, MessagesValue, type GraphNode, StateGraph, START, END } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const State = new StateSchema({
  messages: MessagesValue,
});

const mockLlm: GraphNode<typeof State> = (state) => {
  return { messages: [{ role: "ai", content: "hello world" }] };
};

const graph = new StateGraph(State)
  .addNode("mock_llm", mockLlm)
  .addEdge(START, "mock_llm")
  .addEdge("mock_llm", END)
  .compile();

await graph.invoke({ messages: [{ role: "user", content: "hi!" }] });
```

## Core benefits

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for _any_ long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

-   [Persistence](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.
-   [Human-in-the-loop](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/interrupts): Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.
-   [Comprehensive memory](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/concepts/memory): Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.
-   [Debugging with LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/observability): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
-   [Production-ready deployment](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/deployment): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

## LangGraph ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

LangGraph is inspired by [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pub37252/) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/). The public interface draws inspiration from [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/). LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.

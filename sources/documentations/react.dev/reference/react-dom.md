The `react-dom` package contains methods that are only supported for the web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). They are not supported for React Native.

---

## APIs[](#apis "Link for APIs ")

These APIs can be imported from your components. They are rarely used:

-   [`createPortal`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal) lets you render child components in a different part of the DOM tree.
-   [`flushSync`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/flushSync) lets you force React to flush a state update and update the DOM synchronously.

## Resource Preloading APIs[](#resource-preloading-apis "Link for Resource Preloading APIs ")

These APIs can be used to make apps faster by pre-loading resources such as scripts, stylesheets, and fonts as soon as you know you need them, for example before navigating to another page where the resources will be used.

[React-based frameworks](https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app) frequently handle resource loading for you, so you might not have to call these APIs yourself. Consult your framework’s documentation for details.

-   [`prefetchDNS`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/prefetchDNS) lets you prefetch the IP address of a DNS domain name that you expect to connect to.
-   [`preconnect`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preconnect) lets you connect to a server you expect to request resources from, even if you don’t know what resources you’ll need yet.
-   [`preload`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preload) lets you fetch a stylesheet, font, image, or external script that you expect to use.
-   [`preloadModule`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preloadModule) lets you fetch an ESM module that you expect to use.
-   [`preinit`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preinit) lets you fetch and evaluate an external script or fetch and insert a stylesheet.
-   [`preinitModule`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preinitModule) lets you fetch and evaluate an ESM module.

## Entry points[](#entry-points "Link for Entry points ")

The `react-dom` package provides two additional entry points:

-   [`react-dom/client`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client) contains APIs to render React components on the client (in the browser).
-   [`react-dom/server`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server) contains APIs to render React components on the server.

## Removed APIs[](#removed-apis "Link for Removed APIs ")

These APIs were removed in React 19:

-   [`findDOMNode`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/findDOMNode): see [alternatives](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/findDOMNode#alternatives).
-   [`hydrate`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/hydrate): use [`hydrateRoot`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) instead.
-   [`render`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/render): use [`createRoot`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot) instead.
-   [`unmountComponentAtNode`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/unmountComponentAtNode): use [`root.unmount()`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#root-unmount) instead.
-   [`renderToNodeStream`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToNodeStream): use [`react-dom/server`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server) APIs instead.
-   [`renderToStaticNodeStream`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream): use [`react-dom/server`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server) APIs instead.

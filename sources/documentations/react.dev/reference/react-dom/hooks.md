The `react-dom` package contains Hooks that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). These Hooks are not supported in non-browser environments like iOS, Android, or Windows applications. If you are looking for Hooks that are supported in web browsers _and other environments_ see [the React Hooks page](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks). This page lists all the Hooks in the `react-dom` package.

## Form Hooks[](#form-hooks "Link for Form Hooks ")

_Forms_ let you create interactive controls for submitting information. To manage forms in your components, use one of these Hooks:

-   [`useFormStatus`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus) allows you to make updates to the UI based on the status of a form.

```
function Form({ action }) {
async function increment(n) {
return n + 1;
}
const [count, incrementFormAction] = useActionState(increment, 0);
return (
<form action={action}>
<button formAction={incrementFormAction}>Count: {count}</button>
<Button />
</form>
);
}
function Button() {
const { pending } = useFormStatus();
return (
<button disabled={pending} type="submit">
      Submit
</button>
);
}
```

Validates correct usage of refs, not reading/writing during render. See the “pitfalls” section in [`useRef()` usage](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef#usage).

## Rule Details[](#rule-details "Link for Rule Details ")

Refs hold values that aren’t used for rendering. Unlike state, changing a ref doesn’t trigger a re-render. Reading or writing `ref.current` during render breaks React’s expectations. Refs might not be initialized when you try to read them, and their values can be stale or inconsistent.

## How It Detects Refs[](#how-it-detects-refs "Link for How It Detects Refs ")

The lint only applies these rules to values it knows are refs. A value is inferred as a ref when the compiler sees any of the following patterns:

-   Returned from `useRef()` or `React.createRef()`.
    
    ```
    const scrollRef = useRef(null);
    ```
    
-   An identifier named `ref` or ending in `Ref` that reads from or writes to `.current`.
    
    ```
    buttonRef.current = node;
    ```
    
-   Passed through a JSX `ref` prop (for example `<div ref={someRef} />`).
    
    ```
    <input ref={inputRef} />
    ```
    

Once something is marked as a ref, that inference follows the value through assignments, destructuring, or helper calls. This lets the lint surface violations even when `ref.current` is accessed inside another function that received the ref as an argument.

## Common Violations[](#common-violations "Link for Common Violations ")

-   Reading `ref.current` during render
-   Updating `refs` during render
-   Using `refs` for values that should be state

### Invalid[](#invalid "Link for Invalid ")

Examples of incorrect code for this rule:

```
// ❌ Reading ref during render
function Component() {
const ref = useRef(0);
const value = ref.current; // Don't read during render
return <div>{value}</div>;
}
// ❌ Modifying ref during render
function Component({value}) {
const ref = useRef(null);
ref.current = value; // Don't modify during render
return <div />;
}
```

### Valid[](#valid "Link for Valid ")

Examples of correct code for this rule:

```
// ✅ Read ref in effects/handlers
function Component() {
const ref = useRef(null);
useEffect(() => {
if (ref.current) {
console.log(ref.current.offsetWidth); // OK in effect
}
});
return <div ref={ref} />;
}
// ✅ Use state for UI values
function Component() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
return (
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
{count}
</button>
);
}
// ✅ Lazy initialization of ref value
function Component() {
const ref = useRef(null);
// Initialize only once on first use
if (ref.current === null) {
ref.current = expensiveComputation(); // OK - lazy initialization
}
const handleClick = () => {
console.log(ref.current); // Use the initialized value
};
return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;
}
```

## Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")

### The lint flagged my plain object with `.current`[](#plain-object-current "Link for this heading")

The name heuristic intentionally treats `ref.current` and `fooRef.current` as real refs. If you’re modeling a custom container object, pick a different name (for example, `box`) or move the mutable value into state. Renaming avoids the lint because the compiler stops inferring it as a ref.

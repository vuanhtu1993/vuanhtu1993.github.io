## Why Ship Compiled Code?[](#why-ship-compiled-code "Link for Why Ship Compiled Code? ")

As a library author, you can compile your library code before publishing to npm. This provides several benefits:

-   **Performance improvements for all users** - Your library users get optimized code even if they aren’t using React Compiler yet
-   **No configuration required by users** - The optimizations work out of the box
-   **Consistent behavior** - All users get the same optimized version regardless of their build setup

## Setting Up Compilation[](#setting-up-compilation "Link for Setting Up Compilation ")

Add React Compiler to your library’s build process:

Terminal

```
npm install -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
```

Configure your build tool to compile your library. For example, with Babel:

```
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
plugins: [
'babel-plugin-react-compiler',
],
// ... other config
};
```

## Backwards Compatibility[](#backwards-compatibility "Link for Backwards Compatibility ")

If your library supports React versions below 19, you’ll need additional configuration:

### 1\. Install the runtime package[](#install-runtime-package "Link for 1. Install the runtime package ")

We recommend installing react-compiler-runtime as a direct dependency:

Terminal

```
npm install react-compiler-runtime@latest
```

```
{
"dependencies": {
"react-compiler-runtime": "^1.0.0"
},
"peerDependencies": {
"react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"
}
}
```

### 2\. Configure the target version[](#configure-target-version "Link for 2. Configure the target version ")

Set the minimum React version your library supports:

```
{
  target: '17', // Minimum supported React version
}
```

## Testing Strategy[](#testing-strategy "Link for Testing Strategy ")

Test your library both with and without compilation to ensure compatibility. Run your existing test suite against the compiled code, and also create a separate test configuration that bypasses the compiler. This helps catch any issues that might arise from the compilation process and ensures your library works correctly in all scenarios.

## Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")

### Library doesn’t work with older React versions[](#library-doesnt-work-with-older-react-versions "Link for Library doesn’t work with older React versions ")

If your compiled library throws errors in React 17 or 18:

1.  Verify you’ve installed `react-compiler-runtime` as a dependency
2.  Check that your `target` configuration matches your minimum supported React version
3.  Ensure the runtime package is included in your published bundle

### Compilation conflicts with other Babel plugins[](#compilation-conflicts-with-other-babel-plugins "Link for Compilation conflicts with other Babel plugins ")

Some Babel plugins may conflict with React Compiler:

1.  Place `babel-plugin-react-compiler` early in your plugin list
2.  Disable conflicting optimizations in other plugins
3.  Test your build output thoroughly

### Runtime module not found[](#runtime-module-not-found "Link for Runtime module not found ")

If users see “Cannot find module ‘react-compiler-runtime’“:

1.  Ensure the runtime is listed in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`
2.  Check that your bundler includes the runtime in the output
3.  Verify the package is published to npm with your library

## Next Steps[](#next-steps "Link for Next Steps ")

-   Learn about [debugging techniques](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/debugging) for compiled code
-   Check the [configuration options](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/configuration) for all compiler options
-   Explore [compilation modes](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/compilationMode) for selective optimization

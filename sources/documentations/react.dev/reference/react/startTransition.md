## Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")

### `startTransition(action)`[](#starttransition "Link for this heading")

The `startTransition` function lets you mark a state update as a Transition.

```
import { startTransition } from 'react';
function TabContainer() {
const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');
function selectTab(nextTab) {
startTransition(() => {
setTab(nextTab);
});
}
// ...
}
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

-   `action`: A function that updates some state by calling one or more [`set` functions](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#setstate). React calls `action` immediately with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the `action` function call as Transitions. Any async calls awaited in the `action` will be included in the transition, but currently require wrapping any `set` functions after the `await` in an additional `startTransition` (see [Troubleshooting](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)). State updates marked as Transitions will be [non-blocking](#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition) and [will not display unwanted loading indicators.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators).

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`startTransition` does not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

-   `startTransition` does not provide a way to track whether a Transition is pending. To show a pending indicator while the Transition is ongoing, you need [`useTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) instead.
    
-   You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the `set` function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook return value, try [`useDeferredValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue) instead.
    
-   The function you pass to `startTransition` is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a `setTimeout`, for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions.
    
-   You must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another `startTransition` to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see [Troubleshooting](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)).
    
-   A state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input state update.
    
-   Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.
    
-   If there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release.

## Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")

### Marking a state update as a non-blocking Transition[](#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition "Link for Marking a state update as a non-blocking Transition ")

You can mark a state update as a _Transition_ by wrapping it in a `startTransition` call:

```
import { startTransition } from 'react';
function TabContainer() {
const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');
function selectTab(nextTab) {
startTransition(() => {
setTab(nextTab);
});
}
// ...
}
```

Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.

With a Transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish.

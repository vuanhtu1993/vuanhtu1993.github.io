Important

Agent Optimizer is currently in preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

The agent optimizer in Foundry Agent Service automatically improves your hosted agents by evaluating their behavior and generating better configurations. These configurations primarily include improved system instructions and discovered skills.

Building effective AI agents requires extensive prompt engineering. You deploy an agent with handcrafted instructions, test it against real scenarios, identify weaknesses, revise the prompt, and repeat. This loop is slow, subjective, and doesn't scale. The agent optimizer automates this cycle so you can focus on your agent's core logic.

The agent optimizer runs a closed-loop evaluation and improvement cycle:

1.  **Evaluate the baseline.** The optimizer invokes your agent against a dataset of tasks and scores each response against criteria you define or a built-in default set. The _baseline_ is your agent's score before any changes.
2.  **Generate candidates.** The optimizer produces alternative configurations called _candidates_—rewritten instructions or discovered skills—designed to improve scores.
3.  **Evaluate candidates.** The optimizer tests each candidate against the same dataset.
4.  **Rank and recommend.** The optimizer ranks results by composite _score_, a value between 0.0 and 1.0 that represents aggregate performance, and marks the best candidate with ★.
5.  **Deploy the winner.** A single command promotes the winning candidate and saves its configuration to your agent's environment.

The entire process runs in the cloud. Start it with `azd ai agent optimize` (requires the [azd CLI extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-optimize-hosted-agent#prerequisites)). The run takes 5 to 20 minutes depending on dataset size.

Warning

During optimization, the optimizer evaluates your agent by invoking it against every task in your dataset. If your agent calls external tools—such as APIs, databases, or third-party services—those calls execute during each evaluation run. To avoid unintended side effects (charges, state mutations, or rate limiting), consider using test endpoints or mocking tool implementations during optimization.

Tip

For the best results, generate a dataset tailored to your agent with `azd ai agent eval generate` before running optimization. The optimizer auto-detects the generated `eval.yaml`. For details, see [Create an evaluation dataset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/create-optimizer-dataset).

An optimization _target_ is a specific aspect of your agent's configuration that the optimizer can improve. The agent optimizer automatically determines which targets to activate based on your agent's baseline configuration and the `eval.yaml` settings.

The optimizer rewrites and refines your agent's system prompt. It analyzes baseline performance and generates prompt variations that score higher.

**When it activates:** Instruction tuning runs when your agent has an `instructions.md` file in the baseline config directory. This is the most common optimization target and works well for improving response quality, adherence to task requirements, and reducing inaccurate outputs.

The optimizer improves reusable skills your agent uses. It refines existing skill _bodies_ (the implementation content in each `SKILL.md` file) while keeping skill descriptions unchanged. The agent loads these skills through `load_config()` and appends them to the instruction set.

**When it activates:** Skill improvement runs when your agent has a `skills/` directory in the baseline config. Use skills for agents that need structured, repeatable behaviors. For example, a support agent that follows a specific escalation procedure or a travel agent that checks budget policies.

The optimizer improves tool descriptions and parameter descriptions to help the model call tools more accurately. It does not change parameter types, defaults, or required fields—only the natural-language descriptions are refined.

**When it activates:** Tool optimization runs when your agent has a `tools.json` file in the baseline config. The optimizer analyzes which tool calls succeed or fail and generates clearer descriptions and parameter descriptions.

The optimizer evaluates your agent across multiple model deployments in a single run to find the best quality-to-cost trade-off. For example, it can determine whether `gpt-4.1-mini` handles your workload at lower cost or whether `gpt-4.1` provides a quality improvement that justifies the extra token cost.

**When it activates:** Model selection runs when you include `optimization_config.model_search_space` in your `eval.yaml` with a list of model deployments to evaluate. The optimizer scores each model option against the same dataset and shows the trade-offs.

Note

If the model list includes your agent's current model deployment, it is automatically removed from the candidates (the baseline already represents that model). If no models remain after this removal, you receive a validation error.

Configure model candidates in your `eval.yaml`:

```
# eval.yaml
options:
  optimization_config:
    model_search_space:
      - gpt-4.1
      - gpt-4.1-mini
      - gpt-4o
```

You can combine model selection with instruction and skill optimization in the same run. The optimizer automatically determines which targets to improve based on your baseline configuration and the `optimization_config` settings.

When your agent starts, the `load_config()` function checks several sources in order: inline JSON during candidate evaluation, the resolver API for a fetched candidate, the local `.agent_configs/` directory after you apply a candidate, and finally `None` when no config source is present.

Your agent always works with or without optimization. You don't need feature flags or conditional logic. Call `load_config()` and use the values it returns. For the full resolution order and implementation details, see [Make your agent optimizer-ready](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/make-agent-optimizer-ready#configuration-resolution-order).

| Field | Description | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `instructions` | System prompt and instructions | instruction, skill |
| `skills` | Discovered skill catalog | skill |
| `model` | Model deployment name | model |
| `tools` | Tool definitions (descriptions, parameters) | tool |

The agent optimizer uses two models during an optimization run. Both must be deployed in your Foundry project.

| Model | Config key | CLI flag | Role | Supported models |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Eval model** | `eval_model` | `--eval-model` | Scores agent responses against criteria in the dataset | Any chat-completion model (for example, `gpt-4.1-mini`) |
| **Optimization model** | `optimization_model` | `--optimize-model` | Generates candidate configurations (instructions, skills, tools, model selection) | `gpt-5`, `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.5`, `DeepSeek-V4-Pro`, `DeepSeek-V-3.2` |

The eval model runs once per task per candidate. It reads the agent's response and each criterion, then returns a binary score. The optimization model analyzes baseline results and generates improved candidates across the configured targets (instructions, skills, tools, and models). Because it reasons over the full dataset, a more capable optimization model typically produces better candidates.

```
# eval.yaml
options:
  eval_model: gpt-4.1-mini
  optimization_model: gpt-5.1
```

Important

You must specify `optimization_model`, and the optimization model must be from the supported list above.

This section describes the results table structure, how scores are computed, what score improvements mean, and how to diagnose common issues.

Tip

You can also view optimization results in the [Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/). Navigate to your project, select **Agents**, choose your agent, and then select the **Optimize** tab to see score comparisons, charts, and deployment options.

After an optimization run completes, you see a results table:

```
Results:
  Candidate              Score  Eval  Strategy
  ──────────────────── ───────  ────  ────────
  baseline                0.93  View
  candidate_1             0.90  View  skill_policy-reviewer
  candidate_2 ★           0.94  View  skill_policy-reviewer, tools
  candidate_3             0.94  View  skill_policy-reviewer, system_prompt, tools
  candidate_4             0.93  View  skill_policy-reviewer, tools

  Candidate IDs:
      baseline             cand_a8a951...
      candidate_1          cand_8d5c85...
    ★ candidate_2          cand_a0ea2e...
      candidate_3          cand_2ae7bb...
      candidate_4          cand_0f6485...

  Apply the best candidate locally, then deploy:
    azd ai agent optimize apply --candidate cand_a0ea2e...
    azd deploy
```

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Candidate** | Name of the configuration. `baseline` is your current agent before optimization. |
| **Score** | Composite score across all tasks and criteria, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. |
| **Eval** | Link to the evaluation job in the Foundry portal. |
| **Strategy** | Mutation targets included in the candidate, such as `skill_policy-reviewer, tools`. |

The ★ marks the candidate with the highest composite score. This is the recommended candidate to deploy.

Each evaluator in your dataset produces a raw score for the agent's response. The optimizer processes these scores to produce the composite score shown in results:

-   **Rescale**: Each evaluator's raw score is rescaled to 0–1.
-   **Flip if needed**: If an evaluator is configured so that _lower is better_, the score is flipped so that all evaluators use "higher is better" semantics.
-   **Average**: The rescaled scores across all evaluators and tasks are averaged to produce the composite score.

**Composite score**: The average of all rescaled evaluator scores across all tasks.

| Improvement | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 0.03 | Noise. Not a meaningful improvement. |
| 0.03 to 0.10 | Moderate improvement. Worth deploying. |
| 0.10 to 0.20 | Significant improvement. |
| Greater than 0.20 | Major improvement. Likely from a poor baseline. |

Optimized instructions are often longer and more detailed, which can increase response token usage. Consider these factors:

-   Whether the token increase is proportional to the score improvement
-   Whether the cost increase fits your budget
-   Whether responses are unnecessarily verbose or adding value with the extra length

-   The agent optimizer is available in all regions where [hosted agents are available](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents#region-availability), except Norway East.
-   The agent optimizer is supported for hosted agents that use the [Responses protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents#protocols-responses-invocations-and-invocations-websocket).

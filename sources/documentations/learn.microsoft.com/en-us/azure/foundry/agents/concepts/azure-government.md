This article shows which Microsoft Foundry Agent Service agent types, tools, and publishing options are available in Azure Government — and which aren't. For platform-level features, endpoints, and portal URLs, see [Microsoft Foundry in Azure Government](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/concepts/foundry-azure-government). For an introduction to Agent Service, see the [Foundry Agent Service overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/overview).

Foundry Agent Service is available in the following Azure Government regions:

| Region | Region identifier |
| --- | --- |
| US Gov Virginia | `usgovvirginia` |
| US Gov Arizona | `usgovarizona` |

Agent Service features and tools are available in both regions unless noted otherwise in the tables below.

| Agent type | Available |
| --- | --- |
| Prompt agents | Yes |
| Workflows | Preview |
| Hosted agents | No |

Features marked **Preview** are available for early adoption but might not carry the same compliance commitments (such as FedRAMP, DoD IL5, or CJIS) as generally available features. Confirm the compliance posture of any preview feature with your security and compliance team before using it for production or regulated workloads.

The following table lists tool availability for Foundry Agent Service in Azure Government. For details on each tool, see the [Foundry tool catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/tool-catalog).

| Tool | Available |
| --- | --- |
| Code Interpreter | Yes |
| Custom Code Interpreter | Preview |
| File Search | Yes |
| Azure AI Search | Yes |

Azure Government supports publishing agents. Each published agent gets a stable managed endpoint and a Microsoft Entra identity. You can register the agent with the Entra Agent Registry for discovery within your tenant. Publishing to Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot isn't supported. For more information, see [Publish an agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/publish-copilot).

Agent Service in Azure Government requires `azure-ai-projects` version **2.0.0 or later**. Install the package with:

```
pip install "azure-ai-projects>=2.0.0" azure-identity
```

The token audience and project endpoint differ from public cloud. Set `credential_scopes` to `https://ai.azure.us/.default` and use your Azure Government project endpoint, which has the format `https://{resource-name}.services.ai.azure.us/api/projects/{project-name}`.

The following example creates a simple prompt agent, sends a message, and prints the response:

```
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient

endpoint = os.environ["FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT"]
scope = "https://ai.azure.us/.default"

with (
    DefaultAzureCredential() as credential,
    AIProjectClient(
        endpoint=endpoint,
        credential=credential,
        credential_scopes=[scope],
    ) as project_client,
):
    api_key = get_bearer_token_provider(credential, scope)

    with project_client.get_openai_client(api_key=api_key) as openai_client:
        from azure.ai.projects.models import PromptAgentDefinition

        agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
            agent_name="MyAgent",
            definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
                model=os.environ["FOUNDRY_MODEL_NAME"],
                instructions="You are a helpful assistant",
            ),
        )
        print(f"Agent created (name: {agent.name}, version: {agent.version})")

        conversation = openai_client.conversations.create(
            items=[{"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
        )

        response = openai_client.responses.create(
            conversation=conversation.id,
            extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
        )
        print(f"Response: {response.output_text}")

        openai_client.conversations.delete(conversation_id=conversation.id)
        project_client.agents.delete_version(agent_name=agent.name, agent_version=agent.version)
```

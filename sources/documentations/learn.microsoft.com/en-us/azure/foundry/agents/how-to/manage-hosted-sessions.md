This article shows you how to manage sessions for Hosted agents in Foundry Agent Service. A session is a stateful, isolated sandbox tied to a single logical workload (for example, one user's chat). The platform persists the session's filesystem (`$HOME` and uploaded files) across turns and across idle periods, so the agent can resume where it left off. Sessions persist for up to 30 days, with a 15-minute idle timeout that deprovisions compute and saves state until the session is referenced again. For background, see [Hosted agents in Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents#sessions-and-conversations).

Sessions and conversations are distinct concepts in Foundry Agent Service:

| Aspect | Session | Conversation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What it represents | Sandbox compute and persisted filesystem (`$HOME`, `/files`) | History of messages, tool calls, and responses |
| Identifier | `agent_session_id` | `previous_response_id` or `conversation` (Responses protocol only) |
| Used for | File uploads, working state across turns | Threading turns of a chat together |
| Managed by | The platform, through the `/sessions` API | The platform (Responses); your container code (Invocations) |

The `/sessions` API in this article works the same way for both Responses-protocol and Invocations-protocol agents. What differs is how a per-call invocation binds to a session and whether the platform stores conversation history:

-   **Responses protocol.** Conversation continuity comes from `previous_response_id` or a `conversation` ID—not from the session ID. Reusing the same `agent_session_id` doesn't, on its own, replay prior messages to the model. You have two ways to thread Responses turns:
    
    -   **`previous_response_id`.** Chain each new response to the previous response's ID. Stateless on the client. Each call without an explicit `agent_session_id` lands in a new sandbox, so include `agent_session_id` as well when you need to reuse uploaded files or `$HOME` state.
    -   **`conversation`.** Create a conversation object once via `POST .../endpoint/protocols/openai/conversations`, then pass its `id` on every `responses.create` call. The platform stores the message history under that conversation ID, and a stable `agent_session_id` is automatically associated with the conversation. Subsequent calls reuse the same sandbox without you having to track the session ID.
-   **Invocations protocol.** The platform doesn't store conversation history; your container manages any state your agent needs across turns. Sessions are still useful for `$HOME`/uploaded-file persistence and as a stable handle your code can use to look up its own per-session state.
    

Tip

Sending `agent_session_id` back on follow-up calls binds them to the same sandbox. The invoke endpoints don't infer the session from `previous_response_id` alone. You only need that binding when later turns must see files uploaded through the session's `/files` endpoint or state the agent wrote to `$HOME`. For pure stateless invocations, you can let each call get a fresh session.

The two invoke endpoints accept the session ID in different places. Use the mechanism shown for the protocol you're calling.

| Protocol | Endpoint | Where to put `agent_session_id` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Responses | `POST .../endpoint/protocols/openai/responses` | Request body field `agent_session_id` (or use the `conversation` field, which autobinds a session) |
| Invocations | `POST .../endpoint/protocols/invocations` | Query string parameter `?agent_session_id=<id>` |

For Invocations, the platform reads the query parameter only. Fields named `agent_session_id` or `session_id` in the request body and headers like `x-agent-session-id` are passed through to your container untouched but don't influence which sandbox the platform routes to.

-   A [deployed Hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent) with an `active` version. See [Manage Hosted agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/manage-hosted-agent) for how to check version status.

-   [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.80 or later, authenticated with `az login`.

-   Python SDK: `azure-ai-projects>=2.1.0` and `azure-identity`.

-   [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) version 1.23.0 or later.
    
-   The Foundry agents extension:
    
    ```
    azd ext install azure.ai.agents
    ```
    

The REST API examples in this article use `az rest` to call the Foundry Agent Service endpoints directly. Set the following variables before running the commands:

```
ACCOUNT_NAME="<your-foundry-account-name>"
PROJECT_NAME="<your-project-name>"
BASE_URL="https://${ACCOUNT_NAME}.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/${PROJECT_NAME}"
API_VERSION="v1"
RESOURCE="https://ai.azure.com"
```

Important

The `--resource` parameter is required for all `az rest` calls to Foundry Agent Service data-plane endpoints. Without it, `az rest` can't derive the correct Microsoft Entra audience from the URL and authentication fails.

Note

Session operations are a preview feature. Include the `Foundry-Features: HostedAgents=V1Preview` header in every REST request.

All Python examples in this article use the following client configuration:

```
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient

project = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint="<your-project-endpoint>",
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
    allow_preview=True,
)
```

Note

Session operations are exposed under the `project.beta.agents` subclient. Calls to `project.beta.agents` work without `allow_preview=True`, but `project.get_openai_client(agent_name=...)`—used in this article to invoke Responses-protocol agents—requires `allow_preview=True` and raises `ValueError` without it.

For most agents, you don't need to create a session in advance. When you invoke the agent without an `agent_session_id`, the service creates one and returns it on the response. Capture that ID and pass it on later calls when you want subsequent invocations to share the same sandbox state—for example, files you upload through the `/files` endpoint.

Note

Session continuity _isn't_ the same as conversation continuity. For Responses, preserve message history across turns by passing `previous_response_id` or a `conversation` ID. For Invocations, the platform doesn't store history—your container code is responsible for tracking any per-session state. In both cases, `agent_session_id` only ties calls to the same sandbox.

The Responses endpoint returns either a single JSON payload or a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream, depending on the `stream` field in the request body. The default is `false`. Set `"stream": true` to receive incremental events.

```
AGENT_NAME="my-agent"

az rest --method POST \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/${AGENT_NAME}/endpoint/protocols/openai/responses?api-version=${API_VERSION}" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview" \
    --body '{
        "input": "Find me hotels in Seattle under $200 per night",
        "stream": false
    }'
```

The response payload includes the `agent_session_id` the platform created. To continue using that session on a later call when threading with `previous_response_id`, include `agent_session_id` in the request body:

```
az rest --method POST \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/${AGENT_NAME}/endpoint/protocols/openai/responses?api-version=${API_VERSION}" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview" \
    --body '{
        "input": "Recommend one of those hotels",
        "stream": false,
        "agent_session_id": "<session-id-from-first-response>",
        "previous_response_id": "<id-from-first-response>"
    }'
```

If you thread turns with a `conversation` ID instead, the platform automatically routes every call for that conversation to the same `agent_session_id`. You don't need to pass `agent_session_id` yourself.

When you call `get_openai_client` with an `agent_name`, the returned OpenAI client is routed at the agent's endpoint. The first call creates the session; the response carries the new `agent_session_id` in `model_extra`.

```
openai_client = project.get_openai_client(agent_name="my-agent")

response = openai_client.responses.create(
    input="Find me hotels in Seattle under $200 per night",
)
session_id = response.model_extra.get("agent_session_id")
print(f"Session: {session_id}")
print(f"Response: {response.output_text}")

# Reuse the session and thread the conversation on a later turn.
follow_up = openai_client.responses.create(
    input="Recommend one of those hotels",
    previous_response_id=response.id,
    extra_body={"agent_session_id": session_id},
)
print(follow_up.output_text)
```

If you thread turns with a `conversation` ID instead of `previous_response_id`, the platform automatically routes every call for that conversation to the same `agent_session_id`—you can omit `extra_body={"agent_session_id": ...}`:

```
conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()

first = openai_client.responses.create(
    input="Find me hotels in Seattle under $200 per night",
    extra_body={"conversation": conversation.id},
)
follow_up = openai_client.responses.create(
    input="Recommend one of those hotels",
    extra_body={"conversation": conversation.id},
)
```

```
azd ai agent invoke --input "Find me hotels in Seattle under $200 per night"
```

Invocations agents accept arbitrary JSON request bodies that match the schema your container defines. The platform routes the call to a session and forwards the body to your container; the response shape is whatever your container emits. Sample agents and containers built with the `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` SDK return an SSE stream by default, with a terminal `done` event that carries the `session_id` (the same value as `agent_session_id`) and an `invocation_id`. Your own container can return JSON, NDJSON, SSE, or any other content type.

The first call without an `agent_session_id` query parameter creates a new session. To reuse the sandbox on a later call, pass the session ID as the `agent_session_id` query parameter.

```
AGENT_NAME="my-agent"

# First call — platform creates a new session.
az rest --method POST \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/${AGENT_NAME}/endpoint/protocols/invocations?api-version=${API_VERSION}" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview" \
    --body '{"input": "Hello"}'
```

For an SSE-emitting container like the Agent Service samples, the final `done` event carries `session_id` and an `invocation_id`. To reuse that sandbox on a later call, pass the session ID as the `agent_session_id` query parameter:

```
SESSION_ID="<session_id-from-first-response>"

az rest --method POST \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/${AGENT_NAME}/endpoint/protocols/invocations?api-version=${API_VERSION}&agent_session_id=${SESSION_ID}" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview" \
    --body '{"input": "Continue our previous discussion"}'
```

Important

The Invocations endpoint reads the session ID from the **query string**. Fields named `agent_session_id` or `session_id` in the request body and headers like `x-agent-session-id` are forwarded to your container untouched but don't change which sandbox the platform routes to.

The Python SDK doesn't ship a typed Invocations client. Call the endpoint with `requests` (or any HTTP library) and authenticate with a bearer token from `azure-identity`:

```
import json
import requests
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
token = credential.get_token("https://ai.azure.com/.default").token
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
    "Foundry-Features": "HostedAgents=V1Preview",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}

base = "<your-project-endpoint>/agents/my-agent/endpoint/protocols/invocations?api-version=v1"

# First call — platform creates a new session.
response = requests.post(base, headers=headers, data=json.dumps({"input": "Hello"}))
for line in response.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
    if line.startswith("data:"):
        event = json.loads(line[len("data:"):].strip())
        if event.get("type") == "done":
            session_id = event["session_id"]

# Reuse the session on a later call.
requests.post(
    f"{base}&agent_session_id={session_id}",
    headers=headers,
    data=json.dumps({"input": "Continue our previous discussion"}),
)
```

```
azd ai agent invoke --input '{"input": "Hello"}'
```

The isolation key is a scoping value attached to each session. Every session belongs to exactly one isolation key, and the platform routes session requests so that a caller only sees and operates on sessions tagged with the key the request supplies. The same key applies consistently across all session-related endpoints regardless of which protocol the agent uses:

-   `POST/GET/DELETE .../endpoint/sessions[/{id}]`
-   `POST .../endpoint/protocols/openai/responses` (Responses agents)
-   `POST .../endpoint/protocols/invocations` (Invocations agents)
-   `PUT/GET/DELETE .../endpoint/sessions/{id}/files[/content]`

The isolation key is a partitioning value, not an authentication or authorization mechanism. The Microsoft Entra token on the request authenticates the caller and authorizes the call against the project's role assignments. The isolation key only narrows which sessions that authenticated caller acts on. Apply your application's own access controls at a layer above the agent endpoint when you need to decide which users may act on which keys.

How the key is set depends on the agent endpoint's authorization scheme, which you configure when you set up the agent (see [Configure an agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/configure-agent#enable-protocols-and-authorization-schemes)):

-   **`Entra` (default).** The platform derives the isolation key from the caller's Microsoft Entra token. The `x-ms-user-isolation-key` header is accepted but ignored. Each authenticated caller automatically gets their own scope.
-   **`Header`.** The platform reads the isolation key from the `x-ms-user-isolation-key` request header. Send a stable string per session owner (for example, an end-user or tenant identifier) on every session request, including invocations and file operations. Requests without the header fail. The platform doesn't validate the value, so your client is responsible for choosing the right key for each call.

Create a session in advance only when you need to:

-   Upload files to the sandbox (`/files`) before the agent's first turn.
-   Preallocate a session you can reference from your client code before the first invocation.
-   Pin the session to a specific agent version with `version_indicator`. Each session is bound to a single version at creation time. By default, the platform resolves the version using the agent endpoint's traffic-routing rules (`version_selector`)—for example, `@latest`. Pass `version_indicator` to override that and bind the session to a concrete version (such as `"2"`) so later turns keep using that version even if you publish a newer one. The value must be a concrete version identifier returned by the agent versions API; aliases like `@latest` aren't accepted here.

```
AGENT_NAME="my-agent"

az rest --method POST \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/${AGENT_NAME}/endpoint/sessions?api-version=${API_VERSION}" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "x-ms-user-isolation-key=user-123" "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview" \
    --body '{
        "version_indicator": {
            "type": "version_ref",
            "agent_version": "2"
        }
    }'
```

Omit the body (or send `{}`) to let the platform pick the version using the agent endpoint's traffic-routing rules.

```
session = project.beta.agents.create_session(
    agent_name="my-agent",
    body={},
    isolation_key="user-123",
)
print(f"Session created (ID: {session.agent_session_id}, status: {session.status})")
```

The SDK requires the `isolation_key` keyword on `create_session` and `delete_session`. The server only enforces it when the agent endpoint is configured to read keys from headers—see [Isolation keys](#isolation-keys).

To pin the session to a specific agent version, include `version_indicator` in the body:

```
session = project.beta.agents.create_session(
    agent_name="my-agent",
    body={
        "version_indicator": {"type": "version_ref", "agent_version": "2"},
    },
    isolation_key="user-123",
)
```

Sessions are created automatically when you invoke an agent through `azd`. Manual session creation isn't currently available as a standalone command.

```
az rest --method GET \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/my-agent/endpoint/sessions?api-version=${API_VERSION}" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview"
```

```
sessions = project.beta.agents.list_sessions(agent_name="my-agent")
for item in sessions:
    print(f"Session: {item.agent_session_id} (status: {item.status})")
```

Session listing isn't currently available as a standalone command. Use the REST API or SDK.

```
SESSION_ID="<session-id>"

az rest --method GET \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/my-agent/endpoint/sessions/${SESSION_ID}?api-version=${API_VERSION}" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview"
```

```
session = project.beta.agents.get_session(
    agent_name="my-agent",
    session_id="<session-id>",
)
print(f"Session ID: {session.agent_session_id}, Status: {session.status}")
```

Session management isn't currently available as a standalone command. Use the REST API or SDK.

Deleting a session terminates the sandbox and releases its resources. When the agent endpoint uses `Header` isolation, the isolation key must match the value used when the session was created. When the endpoint uses `Entra` isolation, the platform scopes the delete to the calling identity.

```
SESSION_ID="<session-id>"
ISOLATION_KEY="user-123"

az rest --method DELETE \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/my-agent/endpoint/sessions/${SESSION_ID}?api-version=${API_VERSION}" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "x-ms-user-isolation-key=${ISOLATION_KEY}" "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview"
```

```
project.beta.agents.delete_session(
    agent_name="my-agent",
    session_id="<session-id>",
    isolation_key="user-123",
)
```

Session management isn't currently available as a standalone command. Use the REST API or SDK.

Upload and download files to agent session sandboxes. Each file is scoped to a specific session. The maximum file size for upload is 50 MB.

Note

The Python SDK uses `session_id` as the keyword for `upload_session_file`, and `agent_session_id` for `get_session_files`, `download_session_file`, and `delete_session_file`. Use the keyword name shown in each example.

```
SESSION_ID="<session-id>"

az rest --method PUT \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/my-agent/endpoint/sessions/${SESSION_ID}/files/content?api-version=${API_VERSION}&path=data.csv" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --body @data.csv \
    --headers "Content-Type=application/octet-stream" "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview"
```

```
project.beta.agents.upload_session_file(
    agent_name="my-agent",
    session_id="<session-id>",
    content_or_file_path="./data.csv",
    path="data.csv",
)
```

The `content_or_file_path` parameter accepts a file path string. The SDK reads and uploads the file contents automatically.

```
azd ai agent files upload --file ./data.csv --target-path data.csv
```

```
SESSION_ID="<session-id>"

az rest --method GET \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/my-agent/endpoint/sessions/${SESSION_ID}/files?api-version=${API_VERSION}&path=." \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview"
```

```
files = project.beta.agents.get_session_files(
    agent_name="my-agent",
    agent_session_id="<session-id>",
    path=".",
)
for entry in files.entries:
    print(f"  {entry['name']} (size: {entry['size']}, directory: {entry['is_directory']})")
```

```
azd ai agent files list .
```

```
SESSION_ID="<session-id>"

az rest --method GET \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/my-agent/endpoint/sessions/${SESSION_ID}/files/content?api-version=${API_VERSION}&path=data.csv" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview" \
    --output-file output.csv
```

```
content_bytes = b"".join(
    project.beta.agents.download_session_file(
        agent_name="my-agent",
        agent_session_id="<session-id>",
        path="data.csv",
    )
)
with open("./output.csv", "wb") as f:
    f.write(content_bytes)
```

```
azd ai agent files download --file data.csv --target-path ./output.csv
```

```
SESSION_ID="<session-id>"

az rest --method DELETE \
    --url "${BASE_URL}/agents/my-agent/endpoint/sessions/${SESSION_ID}/files?api-version=${API_VERSION}&path=data.csv" \
    --resource "${RESOURCE}" \
    --headers "Foundry-Features=HostedAgents=V1Preview"
```

```
project.beta.agents.delete_session_file(
    agent_name="my-agent",
    agent_session_id="<session-id>",
    path="data.csv",

```

```

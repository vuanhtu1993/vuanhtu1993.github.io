Note

Some agentic retrieval features are generally available in the 2026-04-01 REST API. However, this article uses the 2026-05-01-preview to demonstrate the full feature set, including features that remain in preview. Preview features are provided without a service-level agreement and aren't recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Important

These features and functionality are part of the 2026-05-01-preview REST API. The 2026-05-01-preview is licensed to you as part of your Azure subscription and is subject to the terms applicable to "Previews" in the [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/welcome/welcomepage), the [Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA) ("DPA"), and the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

The 2026-05-01-preview supports connections to other Microsoft services and third-party services. Use of these services is subject to their respective terms and might result in data processing or storage outside of the Azure compliance boundary, as well as data flowing into the Azure compliance boundary.

It's your responsibility to manage whether your data will flow outside of your organization's compliance and geographic boundaries and any related implications, and that appropriate permissions, boundaries, and approvals are provisioned.

MCP implementations are susceptible to risks, such as attacks, cascading failures, and loss of human oversight. You can mitigate these risks by vetting MCP servers for security and reliability, following [Microsoft's recommended practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/secure-mcp-servers) and [industry best practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices), and implementing approval mechanisms and monitoring cascading behaviors.

You're responsible for carefully reviewing and testing applications you build in the context of your specific use cases and making all appropriate decisions and customizations. This includes implementing your own responsible AI mitigations, such as metaprompts, content filters, or other safety systems, and ensuring your applications meet appropriate quality, reliability, security, and trustworthiness standards. For more information, see the [Azure AI Search Transparency Note](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/responsible-ai/search/transparency-note).

In this article, you learn how to connect a knowledge base in Foundry IQ to an agent in Foundry Agent Service. The connection uses the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/tools/model-context-protocol) to facilitate tool calls. When invoked by the agent, the knowledge base orchestrates the following operations:

-   Plans and decomposes a user query into subqueries.
-   Processes the subqueries simultaneously using keyword, vector, or hybrid techniques.
-   Applies semantic reranking to identify the most relevant results.
-   Synthesizes the results into a unified response with source references.

The agent uses the response to ground its answers in enterprise data or web sources, ensuring factual accuracy and transparency through source attribution.

For an end-to-end example of integrating Azure AI Search and Foundry Agent Service for knowledge retrieval, see the [agentic-retrieval-pipeline-example](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/main/agentic-retrieval-pipeline-example) Python sample on GitHub.

| Microsoft Foundry support | Python SDK | C# SDK | JavaScript SDK | Java SDK | REST API | Basic agent setup | Standard agent setup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✔️ | ✔️ | \- | \- | \- | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |

-   An [Azure AI Search service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal) with a [knowledge base](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base) containing one or more [knowledge sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/agentic-knowledge-source-overview).
    
-   A [Microsoft Foundry project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/how-to/create-projects) with an [LLM deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/create-model-deployments), such as `gpt-4.1-mini`.
    
-   [Authentication and permissions](#authentication-and-permissions) on your search service and project.
    
-   The latest preview Python SDK (version 2.0.0 or later) or the 2026-05-01-preview REST API version.
    
    ```
    pip install "azure-ai-projects>=2.0.0" requests
    ```
    

We recommend role-based access control for production deployments. If roles aren't feasible, skip this section and use key-based authentication instead.

-   [Microsoft Foundry](#tabpanel_1_foundry)
-   [Azure AI Search](#tabpanel_1_search)

-   On the parent resource of your project, you need the **Foundry User** role to access model deployments and create agents. **Owners** automatically get this role when they create the resource. Other users need a specific role assignment. For more information, see [Role-based access control in Foundry portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/rbac-foundry).
    
    Important
    
    The Foundry RBAC roles were recently renamed. **Foundry User**, **Foundry Owner**, **Foundry Account Owner**, and **Foundry Project Manager** were previously named Azure AI User, Azure AI Owner, Azure AI Account Owner, and Azure AI Project Manager. You might still see the previous names in some places while the rename rolls out. The role IDs and core permissions are unchanged by the rename.
    
-   On the parent resource of your project, you need the **Foundry Project Manager** role to create a project connection for MCP authentication and either **Foundry User** or **Foundry Project Manager** to use the MCP tool in agents.
    
-   On your project, create a system-assigned managed identity for interactions with Azure AI Search.
    

Use the following values in the code samples.

| Value | Where to get it | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project endpoint (`project_endpoint`) | Find it in your project details in the Microsoft Foundry portal. | `https://your-resource.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/your-project` |
| Project resource ID (`project_resource_id`) | Copy the project ARM resource ID from Azure portal or use Azure CLI to query the resource ID. | `/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/.../projects/...` |
| Azure AI Search endpoint (`search_service_endpoint`) | Find it on your Azure AI Search service **Overview** page (the service URL) in the Azure portal. | `https://your-search-service.search.windows.net` |
| Knowledge base name (`knowledge_base_name`) | Use the knowledge base name you created in Azure AI Search. | `hr-policy-kb` |
| Project connection name (`project_connection_name`) | Choose a name for the project connection you create. | `my-kb-mcp-connection` |
| Agent name (`agent_name`) | Choose a name for the agent version you create. | `hr-assistant` |
| Model deployment name (`deployed_LLM`) | Find it in your Microsoft Foundry project model deployments. | `gpt-4.1-mini` |

Tip

We recommend you store the project endpoint, search endpoint, and knowledge base name in a `.env` file for local development.

Create a `RemoteTool` connection on your Microsoft Foundry project. This connection uses the project's managed identity to target the MCP endpoint of the knowledge base, allowing the agent to securely communicate with Azure AI Search for retrieval operations.

Note

The `RemoteTool` category and `ProjectManagedIdentity` authentication type are specific to Microsoft Foundry project connections.

-   [Python](#tabpanel_2_python)
-   [REST](#tabpanel_2_rest)

```
import requests
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider

# Provide connection details
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
project_resource_id = "{project_resource_id}" # e.g. /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{account_name}/projects/{project_name}
project_connection_name = "{project_connection_name}"
mcp_endpoint = "{search_service_endpoint}/knowledgebases/{knowledge_base_name}/mcp?api-version=2026-05-01-preview" # This endpoint enables the MCP connection between the agent and knowledge base

# Get bearer token for authentication
bearer_token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(credential, "https://management.azure.com/.default")
headers = {
  "Authorization": f"Bearer {bearer_token_provider()}",
}

# Create project connection
response = requests.put(
  f"https://management.azure.com{project_resource_id}/connections/{project_connection_name}?api-version=2025-10-01-preview",
  headers = headers,
  json = {
    "name": project_connection_name,
    "type": "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/connections",
    "properties": {
      "authType": "ProjectManagedIdentity",
      "category": "RemoteTool",
      "target": mcp_endpoint,
      "isSharedToAll": True,
      "audience": "https://search.azure.com/",
      "metadata": { "ApiType": "Azure" }
    }
  }
)

response.raise_for_status()
print(f"Connection '{project_connection_name}' created or updated successfully.")
```

To improve knowledge base invocations and produce citation-backed answers, start with instructions like the following:

```
You are a helpful assistant.

Use the knowledge base tool to answer user questions.
If the knowledge base doesn't contain the answer, respond with "I don't know".

When you use information from the knowledge base, include citations to the retrieved sources.
```

This instruction template optimizes for:

-   **Higher MCP tool invocation rates**: Explicit directives ensure the agent consistently calls the knowledge base tool rather than relying on its training data.
-   **Clear source attribution**: Citations make it easier to validate where information came from.

Tip

While this template provides a strong foundation, evaluate and iterate on the instructions based on your specific use case and objectives. Test different variations to find what works best for your scenario.

Create an agent that integrates the knowledge base as an MCP tool. The agent uses a system prompt to instruct when and how to call the knowledge base. It follows instructions on how to answer questions and automatically maintains its tool configuration and settings across conversation sessions.

Add the knowledge base MCP tool with the project connection you previously created. This tool orchestrates query planning, decomposition, and retrieval across configured knowledge sources. The agent uses this tool to answer queries.

Note

Azure AI Search knowledge bases expose the `knowledge_base_retrieve` MCP tool for agent integration. This is the only tool currently supported for use with Foundry Agent Service.

If you cannot find the answer in the provided knowledge base you must respond with "I don't know".
"""

# Create MCP tool with knowledge base connection
mcp_kb_tool = MCPTool(
    server_label = "knowledge-base",
    server_url = mcp_endpoint,
    require_approval = "never",
    allowed_tools = ["knowledge_base_retrieve"],
    project_connection_id = project_connection_name

        instructions = instructions,
        tools = [mcp_kb_tool]
    )
)

print(f"Agent '{agent_name}' created or updated successfully.")
```

Important

In this preview, Foundry Agent Service doesn't support per-request headers for MCP tools. Headers set in agent definitions apply to all invocations and can't vary by user or request.

For per-user authorization, use the [Azure OpenAI Responses API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/responses) instead.

Optionally, if your knowledge base includes a remote SharePoint knowledge source, you must also include the `x-ms-query-source-authorization` header in the MCP tool connection. For more information, see [Enforce permissions at query time (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-retrieve#enforce-permissions-at-query-time).

-   [Python](#tabpanel_4_python)
-   [REST](#tabpanel_4_rest)

```
from azure.identity import get_bearer_token_provider

# Create MCP tool with SharePoint authorization header
mcp_kb_tool = MCPTool(
    server_label = "knowledge-base",
    server_url = mcp_endpoint,
    require_approval = "never",
    allowed_tools = ["knowledge_base_retrieve"],
    project_connection_id = project_connection_name,
    headers = {
        "x-ms-query-source-authorization": get_bearer_token_provider(credential, "https://search.azure.com/.default")()
    }
)
```

Create a conversation session and send a user query to the agent. When appropriate, the agent orchestrates calls to the MCP tool to retrieve relevant content from the knowledge base. The agent then synthesizes this content into a natural-language response that cites the source documents.

Citation URLs in agent responses vary by knowledge source. For example, blob knowledge sources return the original document URL, while search index knowledge sources fall back to the MCP endpoint of your knowledge base.

-   [Python](#tabpanel_5_python)
-   [REST](#tabpanel_5_rest)

```
# Get the OpenAI client for responses and conversations
openai_client = project_client.get_openai_client()

# Create conversation
conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()

# Send request to trigger the MCP tool
response = openai_client.responses.create(
    conversation = conversation.id,
    input = """

    """,
    extra_body = {"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
)

print(f"Response: {response.output_text}")
```

The output should be similar to the following (truncated for brevity):

```
Response: Suburban belts display larger December brightening than urban cores, even 
though absolute light levels are higher downtown, primarily because holiday lights 
increase most dramatically in the suburbs and outskirts of major cities. This is due 
to more yard space and a prevalence of single-family homes in suburban areas...

The Phoenix nighttime street grid is sharply visible from space due to the city's 
layout along a regular grid of city blocks and streets with extensive street lighting...

Note

Deleting your agent and project connection doesn't delete your knowledge base or its knowledge sources. You must delete these objects separately on your Azure AI Search service. For more information, see [Delete a knowledge base](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base?#delete-a-knowledge-base) and [Delete a knowledge source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/agentic-knowledge-source-how-to-search-index#delete-a-knowledge-source).

This section helps you troubleshoot common issues when connecting Foundry Agent Service to a Foundry IQ knowledge base.

-   If you get a 403 from Azure AI Search, confirm the project's managed identity has the **Search Index Data Reader** role on the search service (and **Search Index Data Contributor** if you write to indexes).
-   If you get a 403 from Azure Resource Manager when you create or delete the project connection, confirm your user or service principal has permissions on the Microsoft Foundry resource and project.
-   If you use keyless authentication, confirm your environment is signed in to the correct tenant and subscription.

-   Confirm `search_service_endpoint` is the Azure AI Search service URL, such as `https://<name>.search.windows.net`.
-   Confirm `knowledge_base_name` matches the knowledge base you created in Azure AI Search.
-   Confirm you use the `2026-05-01-preview` API version for the knowledge base MCP endpoint.

-   Confirm the agent has the MCP tool configured and `allowed_tools` includes `knowledge_base_retrieve`.
-   Update your agent instructions to explicitly require using the knowledge base and to return "I don't know" when retrieval doesn't contain the answer.

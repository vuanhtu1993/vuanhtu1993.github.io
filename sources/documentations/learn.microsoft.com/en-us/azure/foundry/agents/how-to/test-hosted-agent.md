Important

Items marked (preview) in this article are currently in public preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Test your hosted agent at different levels, from unit testing individual components to end-to-end integration testing against a deployed Microsoft Foundry agent. You also learn when to use structured `azd ai agent eval` runs instead of ad hoc invoke testing.

-   An initialized hosted agent project with agent code and tests. To create a project, see [Initialize an agent project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/init-agent-project).
-   The azd Foundry extensions installed. For installation steps, see [Install the azd Foundry extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/install-cli-foundry-extensions).
-   An authenticated Azure Developer CLI session. Run `azd auth login` if needed.
-   Required test tooling for your language, such as pytest for Python or xUnit for .NET.
-   For deployed integration tests and structured evaluations, a deployed hosted agent. To deploy one, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

| Level | What you test | Tools | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unit tests** | Agent logic, tool handlers, prompt formatting | pytest / xUnit | Fast (seconds) |
| **Local integration** | Full agent running locally against real models | `azd ai agent run` + `invoke --local` | Medium (seconds per request) |
| **Deployed integration** | Agent running on Foundry infrastructure | `azd ai agent invoke` | Slower (includes network round-trip) |
| **Structured eval** | Score the agent against a dataset with adaptive evaluators | `azd ai agent eval` | Slower (LRO) |

Test your agent's core logic without running the full server or calling external models.

-   [C#](#tabpanel_1_csharp)

```
# test_agent.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

def test_tool_handler_returns_expected_format():
    """Test that your tool handler returns valid output."""
    from my_agent.tools import weather_tool

    result = weather_tool("Seattle")
    assert "temperature" in result
    assert isinstance(result["temperature"], (int, float))

def test_system_prompt_includes_required_context():
    """Verify system prompt contains key instructions."""
    from my_agent.config import SYSTEM_PROMPT

    assert "helpful assistant" in SYSTEM_PROMPT.lower()
    assert "weather" in SYSTEM_PROMPT.lower()
```

```
pytest test_agent.py
```

Test your full agent locally, including model calls and protocol handling.

1.  Start the agent in one terminal and send test messages in another:
    
    ```
    # Terminal 1: Start the agent
    azd ai agent run
    
    # Terminal 2: Send test messages
    azd ai agent invoke --local "What's the weather in Seattle?"
    azd ai agent invoke --local "Can you summarize this document?" -f test-doc.json
    ```
    

1.  For repeatable tests, use curl or any HTTP client:
    
    ```
    # Check the readiness probe (expects HTTP 200)
    curl -i http://localhost:8088/readiness
    
    # Test the responses protocol
    curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"input": "Hello, what can you do?"}' | jq .
    
    # Test with a specific session
    curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"input": "Follow up question", "metadata": {"session_id": "test-session-1"}}' | jq .
    ```
    

Wrap local integration tests in a script that starts the agent, runs tests, and cleans up.

```
#!/bin/bash
# test-integration.sh

# Start agent in background
azd ai agent run --port 9090 &
AGENT_PID=$!
sleep 5  # Wait for startup

# Run tests
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9090/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Say hello"}')

echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -e '.output' > /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "[x] Basic invoke test passed"
else
  echo "[!] Basic invoke test failed"
  echo "$RESPONSE"
fi

# Cleanup
kill $AGENT_PID
```

After deploying to Foundry, verify the agent works end to end.

```
# Deploy
azd up

# Test basic invoke
azd ai agent invoke "Hello, what can you do?"

# Test with a new session
azd ai agent invoke --new-session "Start a fresh conversation"

# Test with file input
azd ai agent invoke -f test-request.json
```

Once your agent does something interesting, ad hoc `invoke` calls stop being a reliable signal. You changed a prompt or swapped a tool, ran a couple of prompts, and now you need to decide whether that change was a net win. `azd ai agent eval` is the structured path beyond ad hoc invoke testing: it runs your agent against a fixed dataset and scores the responses with one or more evaluators, so the same change can be measured the same way every time.

Use structured evaluation when:

-   You changed a prompt, tool, or model and want to know whether the change helped or hurt.
-   More than one person is editing the agent and informal smoke tests no longer cover enough surface area.
-   You want a quality gate you can wire into CI to catch regressions automatically.

-   Run this command once after the agent is deployed, typically right after your first `azd up`:
    
    ```
    azd ai agent eval generate
    ```
    
    This is a long-running operation that takes several minutes. It generates a tiny smoke dataset, a default adaptive evaluator scoped to your agent's behavior, and a runnable `eval.yaml`. Pass `--reset-defaults` to overwrite an existing config.
    

-   Once `eval.yaml` exists, run the eval and review the results:
    
    ```
    azd ai agent eval run
    azd ai agent eval show --eval-run-id <run-id>
    ```
    
    `eval run` resolves `eval.yaml` in the agent project root by default and reports per-evaluator scores so you can see exactly where the agent regressed. Use `--config <file>` to point at a specific recipe and `--no-wait` to submit and detach. Check run history and details with `eval show`.
    

The recommended end state is to promote a working local recipe into a project-shared, versioned suite with `azd ai agent eval suites` and run that suite as a CI quality gate. That subcommand isn't yet generally available. Until it ships, version your `eval.yaml` in source control alongside the agent code, and run it from CI with `azd ai agent eval run --config eval.yaml`.

Use this checklist when validating your agent before production:

-   \[ \] Agent starts without errors (`azd ai agent run`)
-   \[ \] Readiness probe returns 200 (`curl localhost:8088/readiness`)
-   \[ \] Basic invoke returns a valid response
-   \[ \] Agent handles invalid input gracefully (doesn't crash)
-   \[ \] Agent responds within acceptable time limits
-   \[ \] Session persistence works (multi-turn conversation)
-   \[ \] Deployed agent responds (`azd ai agent invoke` without `--local`)
-   \[ \] Logs show expected behavior (`azd ai agent monitor --follow`)

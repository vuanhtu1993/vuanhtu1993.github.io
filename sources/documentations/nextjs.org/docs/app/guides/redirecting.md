## How to handle redirects in Next.js

Last updated

March 3, 2026

There are a few ways you can handle redirects in Next.js. This page will go through each available option, use cases, and how to manage large numbers of redirects.

| API | Purpose | Where | Status Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`redirect`](#redirect-function) | Redirect user after a mutation or event | Server Components, Server Functions, Route Handlers | 307 (Temporary) or 303 (Server Action) |
| [`permanentRedirect`](#permanentredirect-function) | Redirect user after a mutation or event | Server Components, Server Functions, Route Handlers | 308 (Permanent) |
| [`useRouter`](#userouter-hook) | Perform a client-side navigation | Event Handlers in Client Components | N/A |
| [`redirects` in `next.config.js`](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs) | Redirect an incoming request based on a path | `next.config.js` file | 307 (Temporary) or 308 (Permanent) |
| [`NextResponse.redirect`](#nextresponseredirect-in-proxy) | Redirect an incoming request based on a condition | Proxy | Any |

## `redirect` function[](#redirect-function)

The `redirect` function allows you to redirect the user to another URL. You can call `redirect` in [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components), [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route), and [Server Functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/mutating-data).

`redirect` is often used after a mutation or event. For example, creating a post:

> **Good to know**:
> 
> -   `redirect` returns a 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code by default. When used in a Server Action, it returns a 303 (See Other), which is commonly used for redirecting to a success page as a result of a POST request.
> -   `redirect` throws an error so it should be called **outside** the `try` block when using `try/catch` statements.
> -   `redirect` can be called in Client Components during the rendering process but not in event handlers. You can use the [`useRouter` hook](#userouter-hook) instead.
> -   `redirect` also accepts absolute URLs and can be used to redirect to external links.
> -   If you'd like to redirect before the render process, use [`next.config.js`](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs) or [Proxy](#nextresponseredirect-in-proxy).

See the [`redirect` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) for more information.

## `permanentRedirect` function[](#permanentredirect-function)

The `permanentRedirect` function allows you to **permanently** redirect the user to another URL. You can call `permanentRedirect` in [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components), [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route), and [Server Functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/mutating-data).

`permanentRedirect` is often used after a mutation or event that changes an entity's canonical URL, such as updating a user's profile URL after they change their username:

> **Good to know**:
> 
> -   `permanentRedirect` returns a 308 (permanent redirect) status code by default.
> -   `permanentRedirect` also accepts absolute URLs and can be used to redirect to external links.
> -   If you'd like to redirect before the render process, use [`next.config.js`](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs) or [Proxy](#nextresponseredirect-in-proxy).

See the [`permanentRedirect` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/permanentRedirect) for more information.

## `useRouter()` hook[](#userouter-hook)

If you need to redirect inside an event handler in a Client Component, you can use the `push` method from the `useRouter` hook. For example:

> **Good to know**:
> 
> -   If you don't need to programmatically navigate a user, you should use a [`<Link>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) component.

See the [`useRouter` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) for more information.

## `redirects` in `next.config.js`[](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs)

The `redirects` option in the `next.config.js` file allows you to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path. This is useful when you change the URL structure of pages or have a list of redirects that are known ahead of time.

`redirects` supports [path](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/redirects#path-matching), [header, cookie, and query matching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/redirects#header-cookie-and-query-matching), giving you the flexibility to redirect users based on an incoming request.

To use `redirects`, add the option to your `next.config.js` file:

See the [`redirects` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/redirects) for more information.

> **Good to know**:
> 
> -   `redirects` can return a 307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code with the `permanent` option.
> -   `redirects` may have a limit on platforms. For example, on Vercel, there's a limit of 1,024 redirects. To manage a large number of redirects (1000+), consider creating a custom solution using [Proxy](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy). See [managing redirects at scale](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced) for more.
> -   `redirects` runs **before** Proxy.

## `NextResponse.redirect` in Proxy[](#nextresponseredirect-in-proxy)

Proxy allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, redirect to a different URL using `NextResponse.redirect`. This is useful if you want to redirect users based on a condition (e.g. authentication, session management, etc) or have [a large number of redirects](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced).

For example, to redirect the user to a `/login` page if they are not authenticated:

> **Good to know**:
> 
> -   Proxy runs **after** `redirects` in `next.config.js` and **before** rendering.

See the [Proxy](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy) documentation for more information.

## Managing redirects at scale (advanced)[](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced)

To manage a large number of redirects (1000+), you may consider creating a custom solution using Proxy. This allows you to handle redirects programmatically without having to redeploy your application.

To do this, you'll need to consider:

1.  Creating and storing a redirect map.
2.  Optimizing data lookup performance.

> **Next.js Example**: See our [Proxy with Bloom filter](https://redirects-bloom-filter.vercel.app/) example for an implementation of the recommendations below.

### 1\. Creating and storing a redirect map[](#1-creating-and-storing-a-redirect-map)

A redirect map is a list of redirects that you can store in a database (usually a key-value store) or JSON file.

Consider the following data structure:

In [Proxy](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy), you can read from a database such as Vercel's [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-config/get-started) or [Redis](https://vercel.com/docs/redis), and redirect the user based on the incoming request:

### 2\. Optimizing data lookup performance[](#2-optimizing-data-lookup-performance)

Reading a large dataset for every incoming request can be slow and expensive. There are two ways you can optimize data lookup performance:

-   Use a database that is optimized for fast reads
-   Use a data lookup strategy such as a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) to efficiently check if a redirect exists **before** reading the larger redirects file or database.

Considering the previous example, you can import a generated bloom filter file into Proxy, then, check if the incoming request pathname exists in the bloom filter.

If it does, forward the request to a [Route Handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) which will check the actual file and redirect the user to the appropriate URL. This avoids importing a large redirects file into Proxy, which can slow down every incoming request.

Then, in the Route Handler:

> **Good to know:**
> 
> -   To generate a bloom filter, you can use a library like [`bloom-filters`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bloom-filters).
> -   You should validate requests made to your Route Handler to prevent malicious requests.

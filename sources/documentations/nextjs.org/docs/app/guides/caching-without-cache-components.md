## Caching and Revalidating (Previous Model)

Last updated

March 3, 2026

> This guide assumes you are **not** using [Cache Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/caching) which was introduced in version 16 under the [`cacheComponents` flag](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents).

## Caching `fetch` requests[](#caching-fetch-requests)

By default, [`fetch`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) requests are not cached. You can cache individual requests by setting the `cache` option to `'force-cache'`.

See the [`fetch` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) to learn more.

### `unstable_cache` for non-`fetch` functions[](#unstable_cache-for-non-fetch-functions)

`unstable_cache` allows you to cache the result of database queries and other async functions that don't use `fetch`. Wrap `unstable_cache` around the function:

The third argument accepts:

-   `tags`: an array of tags for on-demand revalidation with `revalidateTag`.
-   `revalidate`: the number of seconds before the cache is revalidated.

See the [`unstable_cache` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache) to learn more.

### Route segment config[](#route-segment-config)

You can configure caching behavior at the route level by exporting config options from a [Page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page), [Layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout), or [Route Handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route).

#### `dynamic`[](#dynamic)

Change the dynamic behavior of a layout or page to fully static or fully dynamic.

-   **`'auto'`** (default): The default option to cache as much as possible without preventing any components from opting into dynamic behavior.
-   **`'force-dynamic'`**: Force [dynamic rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/glossary#dynamic-rendering), which will result in routes being rendered for each user at request time. This option is equivalent to:
    -   Setting the option of every `fetch()` request in a layout or page to `{ cache: 'no-store', next: { revalidate: 0 } }`.
    -   Setting the segment config to `export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store'`
-   **`'error'`**: Force prerendering and cache the data of a layout or page by causing an error if any components use Request-time APIs or uncached data. This option is equivalent to:
    -   `getStaticProps()` in the `pages` directory.
    -   Setting the option of every `fetch()` request in a layout or page to `{ cache: 'force-cache' }`.
    -   Setting the segment config to `fetchCache = 'only-cache'`.
-   **`'force-static'`**: Force prerendering and cache the data of a layout or page by forcing [`cookies`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies), [`headers()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) and [`useSearchParams()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) to return empty values. It is possible to [`revalidate`](#route-segment-config-revalidate), [`revalidatePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath), or [`revalidateTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag), in pages or layouts rendered with `force-static`.

#### `fetchCache`[](#fetchcache)

This is an advanced option that should only be used if you specifically need to override the default behavior.

By default, Next.js **will cache** any `fetch()` requests that are reachable **before** any Request-time APIs are used and **will not cache** `fetch` requests that are discovered **after** Request-time APIs are used.

`fetchCache` allows you to override the default `cache` option of all `fetch` requests in a layout or page.

-   **`'auto'`** (default): The default option to cache `fetch` requests before Request-time APIs with the `cache` option they provide and not cache `fetch` requests after Request-time APIs.
-   **`'default-cache'`**: Allow any `cache` option to be passed to `fetch` but if no option is provided then set the `cache` option to `'force-cache'`. This means that even `fetch` requests after Request-time APIs are considered static.
-   **`'only-cache'`**: Ensure all `fetch` requests opt into caching by changing the default to `cache: 'force-cache'` if no option is provided and causing an error if any `fetch` requests use `cache: 'no-store'`.
-   **`'force-cache'`**: Ensure all `fetch` requests opt into caching by setting the `cache` option of all `fetch` requests to `'force-cache'`.
-   **`'default-no-store'`**: Allow any `cache` option to be passed to `fetch` but if no option is provided then set the `cache` option to `'no-store'`. This means that even `fetch` requests before Request-time APIs are considered dynamic.
-   **`'only-no-store'`**: Ensure all `fetch` requests opt out of caching by changing the default to `cache: 'no-store'` if no option is provided and causing an error if any `fetch` requests use `cache: 'force-cache'`
-   **`'force-no-store'`**: Ensure all `fetch` requests opt out of caching by setting the `cache` option of all `fetch` requests to `'no-store'`. This forces all `fetch` requests to be re-fetched every request even if they provide a `'force-cache'` option.

##### Cross-route segment behavior[](#cross-route-segment-behavior)

-   Any options set across each layout and page of a single route need to be compatible with each other.
    -   If both the `'only-cache'` and `'force-cache'` are provided, then `'force-cache'` wins. If both `'only-no-store'` and `'force-no-store'` are provided, then `'force-no-store'` wins. The force option changes the behavior across the route so a single segment with `'force-*'` would prevent any errors caused by `'only-*'`.
    -   The intention of the `'only-*'` and `'force-*'` options is to guarantee the whole route is either fully static or fully dynamic. This means:
        -   A combination of `'only-cache'` and `'only-no-store'` in a single route is not allowed.
        -   A combination of `'force-cache'` and `'force-no-store'` in a single route is not allowed.
    -   A parent cannot provide `'default-no-store'` if a child provides `'auto'` or `'*-cache'` since that could make the same fetch have different behavior.
-   It is generally recommended to leave shared parent layouts as `'auto'` and customize the options where child segments diverge.

## Time-based revalidation[](#time-based-revalidation)

Use the `next.revalidate` option on `fetch` to revalidate data after a specified number of seconds:

For non-`fetch` functions, `unstable_cache` accepts a `revalidate` option in its configuration (see [example above](#unstable_cache-for-non-fetch-functions)).

### Route segment config `revalidate`[](#route-segment-config-revalidate)

Set the default revalidation time for a layout or page. This option does not override the `revalidate` value set by individual `fetch` requests.

-   **`false`** (default): The default heuristic to cache any `fetch` requests that set their `cache` option to `'force-cache'` or are discovered before a Request-time API is used. Semantically equivalent to `revalidate: Infinity` which effectively means the resource should be cached indefinitely. It is still possible for individual `fetch` requests to use `cache: 'no-store'` or `revalidate: 0` to avoid being cached and make the route dynamically rendered. Or set `revalidate` to a positive number lower than the route default to increase the revalidation frequency of a route.
-   **`0`**: Ensure a layout or page is always dynamically rendered even if no Request-time APIs or uncached data fetches are discovered. This option changes the default of `fetch` requests that do not set a `cache` option to `'no-store'` but leaves `fetch` requests that opt into `'force-cache'` or use a positive `revalidate` as is.
-   **`number`**: (in seconds) Set the default revalidation frequency of a layout or page to `n` seconds.

> **Good to know**:
> 
> -   The revalidate value needs to be statically analyzable. For example `revalidate = 600` is valid, but `revalidate = 60 * 10` is not.
> -   The revalidate value is not available when using `runtime = 'edge'`.
> -   In Development, Pages are _always_ rendered on-demand and are never cached. This allows you to see changes immediately without waiting for a revalidation period to pass.

#### Revalidation frequency[](#revalidation-frequency)

-   The lowest `revalidate` across each layout and page of a single route will determine the revalidation frequency of the _entire_ route. This ensures that child pages are revalidated as frequently as their parent layouts.
-   Individual `fetch` requests can set a lower `revalidate` than the route's default `revalidate` to increase the revalidation frequency of the entire route. This allows you to dynamically opt-in to more frequent revalidation for certain routes based on some criteria.

## On-demand revalidation[](#on-demand-revalidation)

To revalidate cached data after an event, use [`revalidateTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) or [`revalidatePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath) in a [Server Action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/mutating-data) or [Route Handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route).

### Tagging cached data[](#tagging-cached-data)

Tag `fetch` requests with `next.tags` to enable on-demand cache invalidation:

For non-`fetch` functions, `unstable_cache` also accepts a `tags` option (see [example above](#unstable_cache-for-non-fetch-functions)).

### `revalidateTag`[](#revalidatetag)

Invalidate cached data by tag using [`revalidateTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag):

### `revalidatePath`[](#revalidatepath)

Invalidate all cached data for a specific route path using [`revalidatePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath):

## Deduplicating requests[](#deduplicating-requests)

If you are not using `fetch` (which is [automatically memoized](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch#memoization)), and instead using an ORM or database directly, you can wrap your data access with the [React `cache`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) function to deduplicate requests within a single render pass:

## Preloading data[](#preloading-data)

You can preload data by creating a utility function that you eagerly call above blocking requests. This lets you initiate data fetching early, so the data is already available by the time the component renders.

Combine the [`server-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only) with React's [`cache`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) to create a reusable preload utility:

Then call `preload()` before any blocking work so the data starts loading immediately:
